# Inventory Tracker

This is a simple inventory tracker web application. Users can add items, edit items, delete items, view items in a list, and inspect the details of a particular item. 
They can also add warehouses, edit warehouses, delete warehouses, view warehouses in a list, inspect the details of a particular warehouse, and assign items to warehouses...
as long as they fit! A warehouse's remaining capacity (current capacity) will update as items are added and/or removed, and will be displayed on the warehouse detail page.
